Download SWI Prolog: https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html

Run the file: query.pl

On Windows, the .pl extension is associated with swipl-win.exe and most comfortable way is to double-click the .pl file you want to load in the explorer. This will start SWI-Prolog, which changes directory to the directory holding the file and then loads the clicked file.
